## Answer the following questions in the comments below:

### **1. What are the four principles of Object-Oriented Programming in Java? Provide examples.**

The four principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.

#### **Encapsulation**

Encapsulation involves wrapping data (fields) and methods (functions) into a single unit, typically a class, and restricting access to some components using access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`).

**Example:**

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Private field

    public void deposit(double amount) { // Public method
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() { // Public getter
        return balance;
    }
}
```

#### **Inheritance**

Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods from another class using the `extends` keyword.

**Example:**

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Inherited from Animal
        dog.bark(); // Dog-specific
    }
}
```

#### **Polymorphism**

Polymorphism allows methods to take different forms, enabling method overloading (compile-time) or method overriding (runtime).

**Example: Method Overloading**

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

**Example: Method Overriding**

```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}
```

#### **Abstraction**

Abstraction hides the implementation details from the user and provides only essential information using abstract classes or interfaces.

**Example:**

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with a key.");
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Explain the difference between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize`.**

1. **`final`:**
   - Modifier that can be applied to classes, methods, or variables.
   - A `final` class cannot be extended.
   - A `final` method cannot be overridden.
   - A `final` variable cannot be reassigned.

**Example:**

```java
final class Constants {
    static final double PI = 3.14159;
}
```

2. **`finally`:**
   - A block used in exception handling that executes after a `try` block, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

**Example:**

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 2;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Exception: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    System.out.println("This will always execute.");
}
```

3. **`finalize`:**
   - A method called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed.
   - Rarely used and deprecated in Java 9.

**Example:**

```java
class Resource {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Finalizing...");
    }
}
```

---

### **3. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java?**

1. **Checked Exceptions:**
   - Checked at compile-time.
   - Requires handling using `try-catch` or declared with `throws`.
   - Example: `IOException`, `SQLException`.

**Example:**

```java
void readFile() throws IOException {
    FileReader reader = new FileReader("file.txt");
}
```

2. **Unchecked Exceptions:**
   - Checked at runtime.
   - Extends `RuntimeException`.
   - Example: `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

**Example:**

```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(arr[5]); // Runtime exception
```

---

### **4. How does `HashMap` differ from `HashTable` in Java?**

| Feature       | `HashMap`                                        | `HashTable`                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Thread-Safety | Not thread-safe                                  | Thread-safe                          |
| Performance   | Faster due to no synchronization                 | Slower due to synchronization        |
| Null Values   | Allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values | Does not allow `null` keys or values |
| Introduced    | Java 1.2                                         | Java 1.0                             |

**Example:**

```java
HashMap<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put(1, "One");

Hashtable<Integer, String> table = new Hashtable<>();
table.put(1, "One");
```

---

### **5. Describe the working of the `synchronized` keyword. How does it differ from `ReentrantLock`?**

1. **`synchronized`:**
   - Ensures that only one thread can access a block or method at a time.
   - Simple to use but less flexible.

**Example:**

```java
synchronized void increment() {
    counter++;
}
```

2. **`ReentrantLock`:**
   - Provides advanced locking mechanisms.
   - Offers features like try-lock, time-based locking, and interruptible locks.

**Example:**

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();
try {
    counter++;
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

---

### **6. Explain `Serializable` and `Externalizable` interfaces with examples.**

1. **Serializable:**
   - Marker interface to serialize objects automatically.

**Example:**

```java
class User implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

2. **Externalizable:**
   - Provides control over serialization by implementing `writeExternal()` and `readExternal()`.

**Example:**

```java
class User implements Externalizable {
    private String name;

    @Override
    public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException {
        out.writeObject(name);
    }

    @Override
    public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        name = (String) in.readObject();
    }
}
```

### **7. What are Java annotations, and how are they used? Provide examples of custom annotations.**

#### **Java Annotations**

Annotations are metadata that provide information about a program but do not affect its execution. They are used for:

1. **Compilation checks** (e.g., `@Override`, `@Deprecated`).
2. **Runtime processing** (e.g., `@Entity` in JPA).
3. **Code generation** (e.g., Lombok's `@Getter`).

#### **Built-in Annotations**

- `@Override`: Ensures a method overrides a superclass method.
- `@Deprecated`: Marks a method or class as deprecated.
- `@SuppressWarnings`: Suppresses compiler warnings.

**Example:**

```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}
```

#### **Custom Annotations**

Custom annotations are created using the `@interface` keyword and can include metadata.

**Example:**

```java
import java.lang.annotation.*;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@interface CustomAnnotation {
    String value();
    int priority() default 1;
}

class AnnotatedClass {
    @CustomAnnotation(value = "Test", priority = 2)
    public void testMethod() {
        System.out.println("Executing annotated method.");
    }
}
```

**Processing Custom Annotations:**

```java
public class AnnotationProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Method method = AnnotatedClass.class.getMethod("testMethod");
        CustomAnnotation annotation = method.getAnnotation(CustomAnnotation.class);
        System.out.println("Value: " + annotation.value());
        System.out.println("Priority: " + annotation.priority());
    }
}
```

---

### **8. What is the purpose of the `transient` and `volatile` keywords in Java?**

#### **`transient`:**

- Used to skip serialization of certain fields in a class.
- Transient fields are not serialized during object serialization.

**Example:**

```java
class User implements Serializable {
    private String username;
    private transient String password; // Will not be serialized
}
```

#### **`volatile`:**

- Ensures changes made to a variable by one thread are visible to other threads.
- Prevents caching of the variable in thread-local memory.

**Example:**

```java
class SharedResource {
    private volatile boolean running = true;

    public void stop() {
        running = false;
    }
}
```

---

### **9. Explain the difference between `equals()` and `==`. How can you override the `equals()` method effectively?**

#### **`==`:**

- Compares references (for objects) or values (for primitives).

#### **`equals()`:**

- Compares the logical content of objects.
- Default `equals()` in `Object` checks references; it must be overridden for custom comparison.

**Example:**

```java
class User {
    private String name;

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        User user = (User) obj;
        return Objects.equals(name, user.name);
    }
}
```

---

### **10. Describe the Java Memory Model and how garbage collection works.**

#### **Java Memory Model (JMM):**

1. **Heap Memory:** Stores objects and class-level variables.
2. **Stack Memory:** Stores method-specific values and references.
3. **Method Area:** Stores metadata about classes.
4. **Program Counter (PC) Register:** Tracks JVM execution.

#### **Garbage Collection (GC):**

GC automatically removes unused objects from heap memory.

**Phases:**

1. **Mark:** Identifies reachable objects.
2. **Sweep:** Removes unreachable objects.
3. **Compaction:** Reorganizes heap memory.

**Example of GC Trigger:**

```java
class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo d = new Demo();
        d = null; // Eligible for GC
        System.gc();
    }

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Object finalized.");
    }
}
```

---

### **11. How do you implement custom exceptions in Java?**

Custom exceptions are created by extending `Exception` (checked) or `RuntimeException` (unchecked).

**Example:**

```java
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void checkAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be 18 or above.");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **12. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface? Provide real-world examples.**

| Feature              | Abstract Class      | Interface             |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Multiple Inheritance | Not supported       | Supported             |
| Default Methods      | Allowed             | Allowed (from Java 8) |
| Use Case             | Partial abstraction | Full abstraction      |

**Example:**

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();
}

interface Drivable {
    void drive();
}

class Car extends Vehicle implements Drivable {
    @Override
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with a key.");
    }

    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving.");
    }
}
```

---

### **13. How does the `ConcurrentHashMap` differ from a `HashMap`?**

| Feature          | `HashMap`                                     | `ConcurrentHashMap`               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Thread-Safety    | Not thread-safe                               | Thread-safe                       |
| Null Keys/Values | Allows one `null` key, multiple `null` values | Does not allow `null` keys/values |
| Performance      | Faster for single-threaded apps               | Optimized for multi-threading     |

**Example:**

```java
ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
map.put(1, "One");
```

---

### **14. What is the purpose of the `Callable` interface, and how is it different from `Runnable`?**

| Feature            | `Runnable`                      | `Callable`                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Return Value       | Does not return a value         | Returns a value (`Future`)   |
| Exception Handling | Cannot throw checked exceptions | Can throw checked exceptions |

**Example:**

```java
class MyCallable implements Callable<String> {
    @Override
    public String call() {
        return "Task completed!";
    }
}

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Future<String> result = executor.submit(new MyCallable());
```

---

### **15. Explain the difference between the `Iterator` and `ListIterator` interfaces.**

| Feature                | `Iterator`      | `ListIterator`              |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Traversal Direction    | Forward-only    | Forward and backward        |
| Add Elements           | Not supported   | Supported                   |
| Applicable Collections | All collections | List-based collections only |

**Example:**

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");
ListIterator<String> iterator = list.listIterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println(iterator.next());
}
```

### **16. How does the Java `Stream` API help in functional programming? Provide examples.**

The `Stream` API enables functional-style operations on collections, providing a concise way to manipulate data with features like filtering, mapping, and reducing. It supports:

- **Declarative programming**: Specify _what_ to do instead of _how_ to do it.
- **Lazy evaluation**: Operations are executed only when needed.
- **Parallelism**: Easy parallel processing with `parallelStream()`.

**Common Operations:**

1. **Filter**: Select elements based on a condition.
2. **Map**: Transform elements.
3. **Reduce**: Aggregate elements.

**Example:**

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

class StreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

        // Filter even numbers
        List<Integer> evens = numbers.stream()
                                     .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                                     .collect(Collectors.toList());
        System.out.println("Even numbers: " + evens);

        // Square each number
        List<Integer> squares = numbers.stream()
                                       .map(n -> n * n)
                                       .collect(Collectors.toList());
        System.out.println("Squares: " + squares);

        // Sum of all numbers
        int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

---

### **17. What is the purpose of the `CompletableFuture` class in Java?**

`CompletableFuture` is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package that enables asynchronous programming. It allows you to:

1. **Run tasks asynchronously.**
2. **Chain multiple tasks** with methods like `thenApply()`, `thenAccept()`.
3. **Handle exceptions** with `exceptionally()`.

**Example:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Performing async task...");
            return "Result";
        }).thenApply(result -> {
            System.out.println("Processing: " + result);
            return result + " processed";
        }).thenAccept(finalResult -> System.out.println("Final output: " + finalResult));

        future.join(); // Block and wait for completion
    }
}
```

### **18. How is the `java.util.Optional` class used to handle null values?**

`Optional` is a container for potentially null values. It helps avoid `NullPointerException` by:

1. **Providing default values** using `orElse()`.
2. **Executing actions if a value exists** using `ifPresent()`.

**Example:**

```java
import java.util.Optional;

class OptionalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> optional = Optional.ofNullable(getNullableValue());

        // Check if value is present
        optional.ifPresent(value -> System.out.println("Value: " + value));

        // Provide default value
        String result = optional.orElse("Default Value");
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }

    public static String getNullableValue() {
        return null; // Simulating a nullable value
    }
}
```

### **19. What are lambda expressions in Java? How do they simplify code?**

Lambda expressions are concise representations of functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method). They:

1. **Reduce boilerplate code**.
2. **Simplify passing behavior as arguments**.
3. **Enable functional programming**.

**Syntax:**

```java
(parameters) -> { body }
```

**Example:**

```java
import java.util.*;

class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");

        // Traditional for loop
        for (String name : names) {
            System.out.println(name);
        }

        // Lambda expression
        names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
    }
}
```

---

### **20. Explain method references in Java with examples.**

Method references simplify lambda expressions when a method already exists for the operation. They use `::` and can refer to:

1. **Static methods**: `ClassName::methodName`.
2. **Instance methods**: `instance::methodName`.
3. **Constructors**: `ClassName::new`.

**Example:**

```java
import java.util.*;

class MethodReferenceExample {
    public static void print(String str) {
        System.out.println(str);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");

        // Using a lambda expression
        names.forEach(name -> MethodReferenceExample.print(name));

        // Using a method reference
        names.forEach(MethodReferenceExample::print);
    }
}
```

---

### **21. How does the `ForkJoinPool` framework work for parallelism in Java?**

The `ForkJoinPool` framework divides a task into smaller subtasks (fork) and combines their results (join). It supports **divide-and-conquer**.

**Key Classes:**

1. **RecursiveAction**: For tasks that return no result.
2. **RecursiveTask**: For tasks that return a result.

**Example:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    private int[] array;
    private int start, end;

    public SumTask(int[] array, int start, int end) {
        this.array = array;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (end - start <= 10) { // Base case
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                sum += array[i];
            }
            return sum;
        } else { // Split task
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            SumTask leftTask = new SumTask(array, start, mid);
            SumTask rightTask = new SumTask(array, mid, end);

            leftTask.fork();
            return rightTask.compute() + leftTask.join();
        }
    }
}

class ForkJoinExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = new int[100];
        Arrays.fill(array, 1);

        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        int result = pool.invoke(new SumTask(array, 0, array.length));
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }
}
```

### **22. What is the difference between heap and stack memory in Java?**

| Feature       | Heap Memory                     | Stack Memory                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Storage       | Objects, global variables       | Method-local variables, references |
| Lifetime      | Exists until GC removes objects | Exists until method execution ends |
| Thread-safety | Shared across threads           | Thread-local                       |

---

### **23. How does Java handle multithreading using the `ExecutorService`?**

The `ExecutorService` is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package, providing a framework to manage a pool of threads. It simplifies thread management by decoupling task submission from execution.

**Features:**

1. **Thread Pool Management**: Reuses threads to minimize overhead.
2. **Task Submission**: Executes `Runnable` or `Callable` tasks.
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Stops accepting new tasks while completing existing ones.

**Example:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class ExecutorServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is executing a task");

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            executor.submit(task);
        }

        executor.shutdown(); // Prevents new tasks from being submitted
    }
}
```

---

### **24. Explain the purpose of `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`. How do they differ?**

Both `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` are used for mutable string operations, avoiding the overhead of creating new `String` objects for each modification. The key difference lies in **thread safety**:

- **StringBuffer**: Thread-safe (synchronized).
- **StringBuilder**: Not thread-safe (faster in single-threaded operations).

**Example:**

```java
public class StringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        builder.append(" World");
        System.out.println("StringBuilder: " + builder);

        StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer("Hello");
        buffer.append(" World");
        System.out.println("StringBuffer: " + buffer);
    }
}
```

---

### **25. What is a deadlock in Java? How can it be avoided?**

A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads block each other indefinitely while waiting for resources. It happens when:

1. Threads acquire locks in inconsistent orders.
2. Circular dependencies exist between threads.

**Example of Deadlock:**

```java
class DeadlockExample {
    private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private static final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock 1...");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1: Acquired lock 2");
                }
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 2...");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: Acquired lock 1");
                }
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

**Avoiding Deadlock:**

1. **Lock Ordering**: Always acquire locks in the same order.
2. **Timeouts**: Use `tryLock()` with a timeout for acquiring locks.
3. **Thread Dump Analysis**: Debug using thread dumps.

**Avoiding Deadlock Example:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class DeadlockFreeExample {
    private static final Lock lock1 = new ReentrantLock();
    private static final Lock lock2 = new ReentrantLock();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> executeLocks(lock1, lock2));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> executeLocks(lock2, lock1));

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }

    private static void executeLocks(Lock lockA, Lock lockB) {
        try {
            if (lockA.tryLock()) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lockA");
                try { Thread.sleep(50); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                if (lockB.tryLock()) {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lockB");
                    lockB.unlock();
                }
                lockA.unlock();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### **26. How does the servlet lifecycle work? Explain the role of the `init()`, `service()`, and `destroy()` methods.**

The **servlet lifecycle** defines the process by which a servlet is loaded, initialized, handles requests, and is eventually destroyed by the server.

1. **Servlet Loading and Instantiation**:

   - The web container loads the servlet class and creates an instance when the servlet is first requested or during server startup if configured for early loading.

2. **Initialization (`init()` method)**:

   - Called once when the servlet instance is created.
   - Used to initialize resources, such as database connections.

   ```java
   public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {
       super.init(config);
       System.out.println("Servlet initialized");
   }
   ```

3. **Request Handling (`service()` method)**:

   - Invoked for every incoming request.
   - The container determines the HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) and calls the appropriate method (`doGet()`, `doPost()`).

   ```java
   protected void service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {
       System.out.println("Request handled");
       super.service(req, res);
   }
   ```

4. **Destruction (`destroy()` method)**:
   - Called once before the servlet is removed from memory.
   - Used to release resources.
   ```java
   public void destroy() {
       System.out.println("Servlet destroyed");
   }
   ```

---

### **27. What is the difference between `doGet()` and `doPost()` in servlets?**

| **Aspect**      | **doGet()**                                  | **doPost()**                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**     | Retrieves data from the server.              | Submits data to the server.                      |
| **Data in URL** | Appends data to the URL as query parameters. | Sends data in the request body (hidden).         |
| **Size Limit**  | Limited by URL length (varies by browser).   | No size limitation (depends on server settings). |
| **Caching**     | Cached by default.                           | Not cached by default.                           |
| **Use Case**    | Fetching data (e.g., search queries).        | Sending sensitive data (e.g., login forms).      |

---

**Example:**

```java
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {
    res.getWriter().println("GET request processed");
}

protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {
    String data = req.getParameter("data");
    res.getWriter().println("POST request processed: " + data);
}
```

---

### **28. Explain how session management works in servlets. What are cookies, session tracking, and URL rewriting?**

1. **Cookies**:

   - Small text files stored on the client-side.
   - Used to identify a user and maintain state.

   ```java
   Cookie cookie = new Cookie("username", "john");
   response.addCookie(cookie);
   ```

2. **Session Tracking**:

   - Uses `HttpSession` to store user data server-side.
   - Each user is assigned a unique session ID.

   ```java
   HttpSession session = request.getSession();
   session.setAttribute("user", "John");
   ```

3. **URL Rewriting**:
   - Appends session ID to the URL if cookies are disabled.
   ```java
   String url = response.encodeURL("profile");
   ```

---

### **29. How do you handle file uploads in a servlet?**

- Use Apache Commons FileUpload or Servlet 3.0 file upload features.

**Example:**

```java
@MultipartConfig
public class FileUploadServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {
        Part filePart = req.getPart("file");
        String fileName = Paths.get(filePart.getSubmittedFileName()).getFileName().toString();
        filePart.write("upload/" + fileName);
        res.getWriter().println("File uploaded: " + fileName);
    }
}
```

---

### **30. What is a `RequestDispatcher`? How does it differ from `sendRedirect()`?**

| **Aspect**      | **RequestDispatcher**                        | **sendRedirect()**                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**       | Forwards or includes within the same server. | Redirects to a different URL (may be external). |
| **Performance** | Faster as it doesn't involve a new request.  | Slower as it creates a new request.             |
| **URL Change**  | URL remains the same.                        | URL changes in the browser.                     |

---

**Example:**

```java
// Forwarding with RequestDispatcher
RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("destination.jsp");
dispatcher.forward(request, response);

// Redirecting with sendRedirect
response.sendRedirect("http://example.com");
```

---

### **31. What are servlet filters, and how are they used in web applications?**

Filters intercept requests and responses to perform preprocessing or postprocessing.

**Use Cases**:

- Authentication and authorization.
- Logging and auditing.
- Compression or modification of response data.

**Example:**

```java
@WebFilter("/secured/*")
public class AuthenticationFilter implements Filter {
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) req;
        String user = (String) httpRequest.getSession().getAttribute("user");
        if (user != null) {
            chain.doFilter(req, res);
        } else {
            res.getWriter().println("Unauthorized");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **32. How do you secure a servlet-based web application?**

- Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmission.
- Implement authentication (e.g., form-based, HTTP Basic).
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS.
- Use servlet filters for security checks.
- Set proper HTTP headers (`Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`).

---

### **33. What are the best practices for handling large file uploads in servlets?**

- Set a file size limit.
- Stream the file instead of loading it entirely into memory.
- Use a temporary directory for uploads.
- Provide progress indicators to users.

**Example Configuration**:

```java
@MultipartConfig(
    fileSizeThreshold = 1024 * 1024 * 2, // 2MB
    maxFileSize = 1024 * 1024 * 10,      // 10MB
    maxRequestSize = 1024 * 1024 * 50   // 50MB
)
```

---

### **34. How does a servlet interact with JSP in the MVC pattern?**

- **Servlet**: Acts as the **controller**, processes requests, and sets attributes for JSP.
- **JSP**: Acts as the **view**, rendering the data for the user.
- **Model**: Represents the business logic or database interaction.

**Example:**

```java
// Servlet
request.setAttribute("message", "Welcome to MVC!");
RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("view.jsp");
dispatcher.forward(request, response);
```

```jsp
<!-- JSP -->
<p>${message}</p>
```

---

### **35. What are the key security concerns for servlet-based applications, and how can they be mitigated?**

1. **SQL Injection**:

   - Use prepared statements or ORM frameworks.

   ```java
   PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
   stmt.setInt(1, userId);
   ```

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:

   - Escape user inputs before rendering.
   - Use libraries like OWASP ESAPI.

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:

   - Use CSRF tokens in forms.

4. **Session Fixation**:

   - Regenerate session IDs after login.

5. **Sensitive Data Exposure**:

   - Use encryption for sensitive data.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Avoid exposing stack traces to the user.
